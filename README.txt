This is a utility script for Unity3D. Useful extensions and helper functions found from across the internest and some of my own.

I'm sure there's a license I could copy and paste here. But I am lazy and don't want to find one.

All things found in this repository are available for use in any project, open source of otherwise. No need to credit me, I didn't credit the plaecs I found some of these at.
